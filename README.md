# The Library Mangager 2 Project
## Acknowlegdement 
 This is my repository for making the project 2 from University of Science, Vietnam National University HCMC.

 - Expired time : Dec 30th, 2017 6:PM CST
 - Current status : private
 
 This project is same as the previous project, most of core functions are same. But with project 1, we can't use structure to define a type of data, use two-dimensions array for storing objects and elements, can't export and fetch data using file,.. All the missing and prevented functions in project 1 are now available for using now. And in case of some functions, they are compulsory.

 The roadmap of this project will be available soon on the Wiki, check it [here.](https://github.com/hyperion0201/LibraryManager2/wiki)
